OSXRipper (Alpha release)
=========================

This software was inspired by Harlan Carvey's work on RegRipper - http://windowsir.blogspot.co.uk - and my boredom at having to collect and process plists manually.

Purpose: Dump out system, user and users' iOS backup data in a similar manner to RegRipper on Windows. The output is to text files named after the categories 
of the plugins. There is very little sophistication to the dumped data, the idea being just to get the data collected in one place.

i.e.

OS.txt - Details about OS configurations and settings
Hardware.txt - Details about hardware configurations and settings
Software.txt - Details about installed software
User.USERNAME.txt - Details about user configurations and settings
iOS.USERNAME.txt - Details about users' iOS backup configurations and settings (assumes non-encrypted backup)

Alternatives to OSXRipper
=========================

Here are a couple of alternatives, really wish I had seen iParser before I built OSXRipper...

OSX Auditor - https://github.com/jipegit/OSXAuditor
iParser - http://az4n6.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/automated-plist-parser.html
        - http://www.arizona4n6.com/downloads-2/?did=1

If anyone knows of alternatives I would be more than happy to add them here.

Prerequisite Libraries
======================

Download and place the following jar files in the "osxripper_lib" directory

1. dd-plist.jar from https://code.google.com/p/plist/downloads/list
2. commons-compress-1.5.jar from http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org//commons/compress/binaries/commons-compress-1.5-bin.zip

Running OSXRipper on OSX
========================

To Run:

1. Mount an OSX disk image
2. Open Terminal
3. su admin or skip to 4 if already admin user
4. sudo java -jar osxripper.jar (on OSX access to /private seems to be restricted even on mounted disk paths(?))

To Use:

1. Select root directory of mounted disk
2. Select empty folder/create one for the output files
3. Click Run

Running OSXRipper on the Command Line
=====================================

To Run:

1. Mount an OSX disk image
2. Open Terminal
3. su admin or skip to 4 if already admin user
4. sudo java -jar osxripper.jar --ALL -i <mounted dir> -o <output dir>

Note: On OSX Mavericks

run as root, su to an admin account and type sudo su. Then run as normal


To Refine What is Ripped:
=========================

1. Descriptions of plugins are available from the Help menu Help -> Show Plugin Descriptions
2. Select/deselect plugins as required.

N.B. Plugin selections do _not_ persist when the application is exited. If there are plugins that are irrelevant just move the jar file out of the plugin directory and restart OSXRipper.

Running OSXripper on Other Operating Systems
============================================

- On Linux the OSXRipper needs to be run from command line (i.e. java -jar osxripper.jar). It has been tested on Ubuntu (SIFT workstation) and CENTOS
- On Windows double clicking the osxripper.jar should be sufficient
- OSXripper works on hardcoded directory paths i.e. /private or /Users. To run on a non-OSX system ensure the disk image is mounted or that the files are exported into an appropriate structure.
- For instance on Windows create a base folder (i.e. C:\Temp\OSXThing\) then copy the files of interest into that directory reconstructing the OSX directory structure.
- The application has been tested by exporting folders via FTKImager into C:\Temp\testosx

Extending OSXRipper
===================

OSXRipper uses a plugin system to provide functionality, please read the Dev Guide outlines creating new plugins for plists and SQLite databases.
